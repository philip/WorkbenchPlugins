# Workbench Plugins

A compilation of Workbench plugins and modules. These originate from either other repositories, or were created here.

# What is Workbench?

MySQL Workbench is a GUI to the MySQL database. It also allows user's to add their own plugins, and this repository includes related information for doing that.

# Status of this Project?

I work on the official MySQL documentation, and today I'm cleaning up the MySQL Workbench plugin documentation. It's lacking, so this repository is a place to store examples and thoughts.

# Goal of this Project?

To house many example Workbench plugins, and/or related information, to compliment the official documentation.

# Disclaimer

This is a personal repository and not associated with Oracle. I'm not a lawyer, but figured I'd mention this. :)
